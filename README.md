# RecursiveLab
A recursive method to sum the values in an array of integers.  Create a file ArraySum.java and add the recursive method  public int sumOfArray (Integer[ ] a,int index). Note that ‘a’ is an array of type Integer that is specified in the driver file, and ‘index’ is an integer that shows which number in the array to sum next.   Use the driver class ArraySumDriver.java to populate your array and demonstrate that your method works.
